Archives

In Amazon Glacier, data is stored in archives. An archive can contain up to 40TB of data, and

you can have an unlimited number of archives. Each archive is assigned a unique archive ID

at the time of creation. (Unlike an Amazon S3 object key, you cannot specify a user-friendly

archive name.) All archives are automatically encrypted, and archives are immutableâ€”after

an archive is created, it cannot be modified
Vaults

Vaults are containers for archives. Each AWS account can have up to 1,000 vaults. You can

control access to your vaults and the actions allowed using IAM policies or vault access

policies.
