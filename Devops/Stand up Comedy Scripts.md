### . **Opening:**

- **You:** "Good evening, everyone! We’re [your names], and we work in tech. Which means… we drink a lot of coffee and explain to our families that no, we can’t fix the Wi-Fi."
- **Partner:** "Yeah, I told my mom I work in tech, and now she thinks I can fix her old Nokia 3310…"
  
- **You:** "Being in tech is great. You spend half your time coding and the other half explaining to non-tech people what coding is."
- **You:** "Or the best one: 'Do you use AI in your job?' Sure, I use AI... to predict how long this meeting will last."
  
  - **You:** "And then there’s Agile. The process that’s supposed to make us faster."
- **Partner:** "Yeah, faster at having more meetings!"
  
  - **ou:** "Exactly! Daily standups, sprint reviews, retrospectives… It’s like we're running a marathon of meetings, and the actual work is a 100-meter dash squeezed in between."
- **Partner:** "By the time we finish planning, the sprint is over!"
  
  **Partner:** "Or when people say, 'AI is going to take our jobs!' I’m like, 'Good luck, AI… I still can’t figure out why my script is throwing a 500 error.'"
  
  ### **The Never-Ending Learning:**

- **You:** "And in tech, the learning never stops. Every day there’s a new framework or language."
- **Partner:** "Exactly! One day it’s React, the next day it’s Vue, and tomorrow it’ll be something else. It’s like Pokémon—gotta catch 'em all."
- **You:** "By the time you master one thing, it’s already outdated. It’s like, 'Congratulations! You’re now an expert in something nobody uses anymore.'"
  
  
  ### 13. **Cloud Migration Woes:**

- **Partner:** "And let’s not forget cloud migrations. Every company wants to 'move to the cloud.' It’s like a magical place where all your problems just float away."
- **You:** "Yeah, except the problems don’t float away… they multiply. Now you’ve got data somewhere in the cloud, and no one knows exactly where!"
- **Partner:** "Cloud migrations are basically just an elaborate way to say, 'We’re going to spend the next six months trying to figure out why nothing works the way it used to.'"
- **You:** "And there’s always that one person in the meeting who says, 'Well, in the cloud, this should be easier.' Easier? It’s like trying to park a car in an invisible garage!"
  
  
  - **Partner:** "The pipeline breaks, you fix it, it breaks again… and before you know it, you’re caught in an infinite loop of fixing things that were supposed to save time."
- **You:** "At this point, I’m starting to think CI/CD stands for 'Constant Issues / Continuous Disasters.'"
  
  
  - **You:** "And don’t forget how DevOps gets pulled into every meeting."
- **Partner:** "Yeah, like every time something breaks, everyone just looks at the DevOps team like, 'Can you fix it?'"
- **You:** "They walk into meetings like, 'Okay, who broke the pipeline this time?'"
- **Partner:** "And they somehow always stay calm, like ‘We’ll have to reboot the production cluster, reroute the traffic, and sacrifice a goat.’ Just another day in DevOps."
  
  he security team always says, 'Make sure everything is secure!' Meanwhile, we’re still Googling how to make our SSL certificates work."
