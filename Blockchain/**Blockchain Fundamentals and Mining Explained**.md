### 1. Where Are Transactions Stored in Blockchain?
Transactions in a blockchain are stored in **blocks**, which are linked together in chronological order to form a **blockchain**. Each block typically contains:
- A **list of transactions**.
- Metadata, including a **timestamp**, **block number**, and **hash** linking it to the previous block.
- A **Merkle root**, summarizing all transactions in the block.

#### Storage Across Nodes
Every **full node** in the blockchain network stores a complete copy of the blockchain, ensuring redundancy and decentralization. **Light nodes** store only part of the blockchain (e.g., block headers).

### 2. Node Storage and Exiting Nodes
Blockchain nodes store transaction data, and if a node exits the network:
- The blockchain remains unaffected as other nodes hold copies of the data.
- When the node rejoins, it synchronizes with the latest blockchain data.

#### Managing Storage
To manage growing storage requirements, nodes use:
- **Pruning**: Deleting old data locally while retaining the current state.
- **Sharding** (in blockchains like Ethereum 2.0): Splitting the blockchain into smaller parts to reduce the storage burden on each node.

### 3. Components: Block, Node, and Transaction
- **Transaction**: A record of an asset transfer (e.g., sending Bitcoin or interacting with a smart contract).
- **Block**: A group of transactions added to the blockchain.
- **Node**: A computer or device that stores and verifies blockchain data. Types include **full nodes**, **light nodes**, and **validator/mining nodes**.

### 4. How Transactions Are Stored
Each transaction contains:
- Sender and recipient addresses.
- Amount transferred.
- Digital signature for authenticity.
- Optional data fields (e.g., in Ethereum, for smart contract interactions).

A single transaction typically ranges from **100 bytes to a few kilobytes**.

### 5. Communication Between Nodes
Nodes communicate in a **peer-to-peer (P2P)** fashion using network protocols like **TCP/IP**:
- **Broadcasting**: Transactions and blocks are shared across the network.
- **Validation**: Nodes independently verify the data before forwarding it.
- **Synchronization**: New nodes download blockchain data incrementally or use snapshots.

### 6. Proof of Stake (PoS)
PoS is a consensus mechanism where validators secure the network by **staking cryptocurrency** instead of performing energy-intensive computations.
- Validators propose and validate blocks.
- Selection depends on the amount staked and randomness.
- Honest behavior earns rewards, while malicious actions lead to penalties (**slashing**).
- PoS is energy-efficient and scalable compared to Proof of Work (PoW).

### 7. Proof of Work (PoW) and Mining
In PoW systems like Bitcoin, **miners** compete to solve cryptographic puzzles to add new blocks:
1. **Gather Transactions**: Miners collect unconfirmed transactions.
2. **Create a Block**: Transactions are grouped, and a puzzle is generated.
3. **Solve the Puzzle**: Miners adjust a nonce to generate a hash that meets the network’s difficulty.
4. **Broadcast the Block**: The first miner to solve the puzzle broadcasts the block for validation.
5. **Earn Rewards**: Miners receive block rewards (e.g., Bitcoin) and transaction fees.

### 8. What Does a Transaction Contain?
Transactions typically include:
- Sender and recipient addresses.
- Amount transferred.
- Transaction fee.
- Digital signature.
- Timestamp and transaction ID.

In platforms like Ethereum, transactions may also contain:
- **Gas price** and **gas limit**.
- Data fields for smart contract interactions.

### 9. Prerequisites for Mining
#### **Hardware Requirements**
- **ASIC Miners**: Specialized hardware for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.
- **GPUs**: For mining altcoins and Ethereum (pre-PoS).
- **Cooling Systems** and sufficient **power supply**.

#### **Software Requirements**
- Mining software (e.g., CGMiner for Bitcoin, PhoenixMiner for Ethereum).
- A wallet to store rewards.
- Optional: Mining pool software for collaborative mining.

#### **Other Requirements**
- Stable internet connection.
- Affordable electricity for profitability.
- Compliance with local regulations and taxation.

### 10. What Happens If Mining Stops?
If all miners or validators stop:
- **No new blocks** would be created, and the network would freeze.
- Transactions would remain unconfirmed in the mempool.
- Security would weaken, leaving the network vulnerable.

However, this scenario is unlikely due to strong economic incentives and decentralized participation.
